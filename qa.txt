Hi all,
I have a few questions about the task:
- I couldn't find anything in Figma related to attachments- I couldn't find anything in the requirementsÂ related to "due date" and "tags", and nothing in figma about how to set the values
In terms of usability, I find the weather icon in the notes a bit confusing, especially with a due date: is the weather current, or forecasted for the due date?
I'm sure I will come up with more questions,Jose
